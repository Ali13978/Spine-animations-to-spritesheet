# Spine 2D Animation to Sprite Sheet Converter for Unity

Easily convert your **Spine** skeletal animations into **sprite sheets** for use in Unity or any 2D game pipeline.  
Perfect for developers who want the smoothness of Spine animations but need them in a *frame-by-frame* format.

> **Note:** Make sure your camera is large enough so that **every frame** of the animation is fully inside it.
